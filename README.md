# IT3385-MLOPS-wileen-roanne
project description: 
MLOPS streamlines the process of deploying Machine Learning models to production and then maintaining and monitoring them. In this project, we will be covering two types of machine leanring models.
1. Wheat type classification model: To predict wheat type based on its attributes on its kernel. Type 1- Kama, Type 2 - Rosa and Type 3 - Canadian.
2. Car price regression model: To predict used care in India based on its characteristics.

## Model 1 (Wheat Type Classification Model)
Description: This classification model predicts what type of seed based on it's kernel attribute. There are a total of 3 seeds. Type 1- Kama, Type 2 - Rosa and Type 3 - Canadian.
